## What is XileHUD?

I initially created this HUD for my personal use. As a self-employed trader, I spend a lot of time on the PC, and Path of Exile is the perfect game for that. I've been coding as a hobby for some years now, mainly building tools that help me get things done faster. A friend saw the overlay and told me I should release it to the public, so here we are. I hope you find it as useful as I do!

## ‚ú® Features

### Merchant History
One of the core motivations for this project. In-game, the vendor history is capped at the last 100 items and doesn't show the items themselves. XileHUD provides a local, searchable, and filterable history of your merchant interactions, allowing you to save and analyze more than just the last 100 transactions.

### Detailed Modifier Overview
Get an in-depth look at item modifiers with advanced filters, weighting, and more. Instantly understand the power of an item.

### Crafting Currency Helper
Ever wondered about the different Essences, Omens, or Runes available? Instead of manually searching the trade site, simply press Ctrl+Q on any currency to see a detailed, filterable list of what they do.

### Smart Clipboard
The overlay is intelligent. If you copy a rare Strength-based chestplate, for example, the modifiers page will automatically open with the "STR Chest" category pre-selected. This functionality extends to Omens, Essences, Catalysts, Uniques, Flasks, Relics, and much more, saving you valuable clicks.

### Character Planner
View all available Gems, Atlas Passives, Keystones, and Ascendancy passives. Filter everything to your needs to plan your next build or optimize your current one. A comprehensive glossary is also included.

### Quest Passives Helper
With the absence of the /passives command in PoE2 and the increased number of campaign rewards, this tool is essential. Track and filter all sources of Spirit, passive points, resistances, and attributes. Check them off as you collect them to ensure you never miss a permanent character boost again.
<!-- Screenshot placeholder: docs/images/quest-passives.png -->

### Item Database
Browse all base items and Uniques in the game through a clean, organized interface with powerful filtering options. For instance, find the highest evasion base armor with just two clicks.

### Map Regex Tool
A simple tool to make juicing maps more straightforward. Select the mods you want or don't want, and copy the generated regex directly into the game.
<!-- Screenshot placeholder: docs/images/map-regex.png -->

### Focused Gaming
The overlay is designed to be unobtrusive and can be quickly toggled with a hotkey, keeping you focused on the game.

### Local Database
Most features are fully local and can be used offline. An internet connection and account authentication are only required for the Merchant History to fetch your data from the PoE servers.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

I usually add features that I personally think would help me save time, so when you see an update, it's likely something I'm actively using myself.

- Spectre Database: A comprehensive list of spectres and their abilities.
- Shareable Crafting Recipes: Create and share crafting processes with the community.
- Expanded Regex Tool: Add more categories for deeper customization.
- PoE1 Version: Complete the Path of Exile 1 adaptation.
- And much more!: I have many other ideas in mind to continue making our lives in Wraeclast easier.
