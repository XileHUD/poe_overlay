# XileHUD (Beta)

<strong>Low-latency local PoE2 overlay + modifier intelligence. Copy an item ‚Üí structured breakdown, tiers, fractured / desecrated emphasis, sockets & runes.</strong><br/>

## Why it exists
Built as a personal efficiency tool (speed-check fractured value, identify chase tiers, preserve merchant sale history) ‚Äì released because others asked for the same data clarity without remote round‚Äëtrips.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
1. Instant Item Parsing (clipboard driven: copy ‚Üí overlay updates)
2. Tier Inference Engine (aggregates combined stats; hides tiers on uniques to reduce noise)
3. Fractured & Desecrated Highlighting (prioritized ordering at top)
4. Sockets + Rune Visualization inline
5. Merchant History (local archive, fast filters: timeframe, class, fractured/desecrated, runes, search)
6. Smart Clipboard (only active when needed; no constant global polling spam)
7. Local Modifier Dataset (bundled JSON; optional external override)
8. Offline Operation (no network calls for core flows)
9. Future Helpers: crafting currency guidance, regex builder expansion, PoE1 parity
10. Hotkey Toggle (`Ctrl+Q` planned; current builds rely on window focus + copy trigger)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (End Users)
1. Download portable EXE from Releases.
2. Run it (unsigned: use ‚ÄúMore info ‚Üí Run anyway‚Äù).
3. Launch PoE2 (windowed/borderless recommended).
4. Copy an item in inventory (`Ctrl+C`).
5. Overlay panel populates automatically.

Tray:
- Hide/restore from system tray icon.
- Quit via tray menu or window close.

Data Override Priority:
| Priority | Mechanism | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `XILEHUD_DATA_DIR` env var | Point to custom JSON set |
| 2 | `%APPDATA%/XileHUD/overlay/overlay-config.json` | User-configurable path |
| 3 | Bundled resources | Default packaged dataset |

---

## ÔøΩ Privacy
| Action | Network? | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Item parse | ‚ùå | Pure local processing |
| Tier lookup | ‚ùå | JSON / in-memory only |
| Merchant logging | ‚ùå | Local SQLite/JSON (export manual) |
| Telemetry | ‚ùå | None implemented |
| Auth | ‚ùå | Not used in current beta |

---

## üß™ Tier Logic (Summary)
1. Extract extended hash groups (explicit/fractured/desecrated)
2. Aggregate magnitudes for merged multi-roll lines
3. Map magnitude ranges to scraped tier intervals
4. Prefer fractured context (locked) > generic explicit potential
5. Suppress tiers for uniques

Remaining edge cases are logged locally for heuristic refinement (e.g. near-boundary dual partial rolls).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
| Area | State |
|------|-------|
| Code signing | Not yet (SmartScreen warning) |
| Auto-update | Manual download per release |
| Settings UI | Pending (hotkeys, layout persistence) |
| PoE1 Support | Not shipped yet |
| Data refresh | Requires new release (diff patcher planned) |

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Short / Mid)
- Code signing & incremental updater
- Configurable hotkeys + overlay profiles
- Live modifier diff ingestion (no full repackage)
- Crafting recipe helper / shareable templates
- Regex tool expansion (influence sets, rune families, atlas passive groups)
- Spectre database (minion archetype surfacing)
- PoE1 adapter layer
- Lightweight local price memory (no external API spam)

Exploratory: craft simulation sandbox; passive tree diff preview if stable model emerges.

## üêû Reporting Issues
Please include:
1. App version (filename)
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Item text (if tier mismatch) + expected reference (e.g. PoE2DB link)
4. Optional terminal output (run EXE from PowerShell)

## üõ† Build From Source
Prereqs: Node 18+, Git, Windows (for portable target)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/XileHUD/poe_overlay.git
cd poe_overlay\packages\overlay
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production (unsigned portable):
```powershell
npm run dist:unsigned
```
Output: `dist_electron/XileHUD-<version>-portable.exe`

Just JS bundles:
```powershell
npm run build
```

Packaging notes:
- Uses electron-builder (portable target)
- Data falls back to `process.resourcesPath/data/poe2`

---

## üôå Contributing
Open to PRs now (no ‚Äúwait until stable‚Äù gate). Helpful areas:
- Tier aggregation edge cases
- Performance profiling (clipboard loop / render diff)
- Additional item context panels

Flow:
1. Fork & branch
2. Fresh `npm install`
3. Run dev overlay, reproduce intended change
4. Commit w/ clear conventional message (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:)
5. Open PR with before/after rationale & screenshots if UI
