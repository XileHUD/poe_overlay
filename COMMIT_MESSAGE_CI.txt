ci: add GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds

Add CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions for multi-platform builds:

Features:
- Automatic builds on push to main/master/feature/linux-support branches
- Multi-platform support: Linux (AppImage), Windows (NSIS), macOS (DMG)
- Automatic release creation on version tags (v*)
- PR validation workflow for code quality checks
- Artifact uploading for all platforms
- Caching of npm dependencies for faster builds

Workflows:
- build.yml: Main build workflow with matrix strategy for all platforms
  * Linux: builds AppImage with electron-builder
  * Windows: builds unsigned installer (NSIS)
  * macOS: builds DMG package
  * Automatic release creation on tags with generated release notes
  
- pr-check.yml: Fast PR validation
  * TypeScript type checking
  * Build verification
  * Runs on every pull request to main/master

The build workflow can also be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch.

Time to build: ~30-35 minutes for all platforms
Artifacts retention: 90 days (default)
Release creation: automatic on tags matching v*
